Anagram
===========

Two sentences are anagram if they are composed by the same letters (“debit card” = “bad credit”)

##Problem Description

The goal is to take a word in input and find all the **two-words** anagrams.

There is a dictionnary in this repository. You can also take your words list if you want.

##Example
