RomanNumbers Kata
===========

##Problem description:

The Romans were a clever bunch.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)

You should write a function to convert decimal numbers to Roman Numbers.

##Example:

     1 -> I
     10 -> X
     7 -> VII
     4139 -> MMMMCXXXIX
